# Setting up for development

Ensure you are running the correct version of Node. The repo includes an
`.nvmrc` file that includes the version number I use.

Clone your fork of this repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:USERNAME/browseratops.git
```

Move to folder:

```
cd browseratops
```

Install dependencies:

```
npm i
```

Run Browseratops in dev mode:

```
npm start
```

> ℹ️ If you already have a copy of Browseratops installed, it's advisable to
> quit that first as the two apps will look identical in the menubar.

> ℹ️ When setting the development Browseratops as the default browser, you will
> need to select "Electron".
