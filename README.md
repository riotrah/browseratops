# Browseratops

Browseratops is an open-source (GPLv3 license), browser prompter for windows,
and theoretically, for macOS, by virtue of its being a fork of @will-stone's
phenomenal browserosaurus project. It works by setting itself as the default
browser; any clicked links in non-browser apps are now sent to Browseratops
where you are presented with a menu of all your installed browsers. You may now
decide which app youâ€™d like to continue opening the link with.

## Installation

~~Download Browseratops from the
[GitHub releases page](https://github.com/riotrah/browseratops/releases/latest).
Select **x64** for Intel machines, or **arm64** for Apple Silicon (M1)
machines.~~ ( upstream OG instructions )

Hopefully will one day support various windows package managers.

> ðŸš¨ **Please note that Browseratops only officially supports the version of
> Windows that I (@riotrah) currently use, which you can assume to be the latest
> stable version.**
